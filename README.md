This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS.  Incorrect spacing around arithmetic operators within the `calc()` function can lead to unexpected rendering behavior across different browsers. The `bug.css` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. The problem is that extra spaces around the operators can break the calculation in some browsers, leading to unexpected layout issues.
